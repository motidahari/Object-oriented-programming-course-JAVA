In this project we will implement the interfaces.
There are three classes which we will use in order to implement the interfaces.
(We will elaborate each class by it's section)


**********************************_functions implements_**********************************‚Äù

*********_NodeData class function:_*********

The first class is called "NodeData Class".
This class represents the individual Vertex and all it's connector's by implementing the interface "node_data" in the code "NodeData".
The Data Structures which I used is "HashMap" since it is very effective.
In this class we will perform the following steps:

    /**
     * constructor for NodeData to create new empty hashMap for the Neighbors
     * @param
     * @return none return
     */
public NodeData();

    /**
     * constructor for NodeData to create new empty hashMap for the Neighbors with specific key
     * @param key of the node
     * @return none return
     */
public NodeData();

    /**
     * Return the key (id) associated with this node.
     * Note: each node_data should have a unique key.
     * @return this.key
     */
public int getKey();

    /**
     * This method returns a collection with all the Neighbor nodes of this node_data
     * @return collection of all the Neighbors by the node
     */
public Collection<node_data> getNi();

    /**
     * This method adds the node_data (t) to this node_data.
     * check if to the node in the class has Neighbor by the key of node_data t
     * if already has Neighbor to the node by node t.getKey we doing nothing
     * if not add the node to hashMap and we will increase the param size(Num Of Neighbor)
     * @param t node
     */
public void addNi(node_data t);

    /**
     * Removes the edge this-key,
     * check if to the node in the class has Neighbor by the key of node_data node
     * if to the node has Neighbor node.getKey() we delete the node and update the size
     * if not we doing nothing
     * @param node node_data
     */
public void removeNode(node_data node);

    /**
     * return the remark (meta data) associated with this node.
     * we use in the info to the path in the class GraphAlgo
     * @return info String
     */	
public String getInfo();

    /**
     * Allows changing the remark (meta data) associated with this node.
     *  change the value of the info
     * @param s String
     */	
public void setInfo(String s);

    /**
     * Temporal data (aka color: e,g, white, gray, black)
     * which can be used be algorithms
     * we use on the tag param to count the path in the class GraphAlgo
     * @return tag int
     */	
public int getTag();

    /**
     * Allow setting the "tag" value for temporal marking an node - common
     * practice for marking by algorithms.
     * update the value of the tag
     * @param t - the new value of the tag
     */	
public void setTag(int t);

    /**
     * get all data by node
     * @param node - the new value of the tag
     */
public String toString(node_data node);

    /**
     * run by Neighbors of node and return String of all the Neighbors
     * help func to toString
     * @param node - the new value of the tag
     */
public String getAllNeighborsByNodeId(node_data node);



*********_Graph_DS classs function:_*********


The second class is called "Graph_DS Class".
This class represents all Vertexes which are what make our graph.
This graph is called "Undirected Graph".
This class creates a graph from each individual vertex (node) by implement the interface "graph"
in the code "Graph_DS" to create the graph itself.
The Data Structures which I used is "HashMap" since it is very effective.
In this class we will perform the following steps:


    /**
     * constructor for Graph_DS to create new empty hashMap(Vertex) for the graph
     * @return none return
     */
 public Graph_DS()


    /**
     * constructor for Graph_Algo to create object with initialization to the graph
     * @param g graph
     * @return none return
     */
    public Graph_Algo(graph g);


    /**
     * return the node_data by the node_id,
     * check if has Vertex in the graph by node key
     * @param key - the node_id
     * @return the node_data by the node_id, null if none.
     */
public node_data getNode(int key);

    /**
     * return true iff (if and only if) there is an edge between node1 and node2
     * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
     * check if has two Vertex in the graph by node1 key && node2 key
     * if the two nodes are exist we check if to node1 has Neighbor node2 && to node2 has Neighbor node1
     * @param node1
     * @param node2
     * @return true if are they Neighbors from both sides false if they don't have
     */
public boolean hasEdge(int node1, int node2);

    /**
     * add a new node to the graph with the given node_data.
     * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
     * check if Vertex in the graph by node key if to the graph does not have such a vertex
     * so we add the Vertex to the graph and we update the size & modeCount
     * else Doing nothing
     * @param n node_data
     *
public void addNode(node_data n);

    /**
     * Connect an edge between node1 and node2.
     * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
     * Note2: if the edge node1-node2 already exists - the method simply does nothing.
     * check if has two Vertex in the graph by node1 key && node2 key
     * if the two nodes are exist we check if to node1 has Neighbor node2 || to node2 has Neighbor node1
     * if one of the vertices does not have the other neighbor we connect them and update the edgeSize && modeCount
     * @param node1
     * @param node2
     */
public void connect(int node1, int node2);

    /**
     * This method return a pointer (shallow copy) for the
     * collection representing all the nodes in the graph.
     * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
     * return all Vertex in the graph
     * @return Collection<node_data>
     */
public Collection<node_data> getV();

    /**
     * This method return a collection of  the
     * collection representing all the nodes connected to node_id
     * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
     * check if Vertex in the graph by node key if to the graph has such a vertex
     * so we return the Neighbors by the node key
     * else return null
     * @param node_id
     * @return Collection<node_data> or null if the node isn't exist
     */
public Collection<node_data> getV(int node_id);

    /**
     * Delete the node (with the given ID) from the graph -
     * and removes all edges which starts or ends at this node.
     * This method should run in O(n), |V|=n, as all the edges should be removed.
     * check if Vertex in the graph by node key if to the graph has such a vertex
     * so we delete the node from the graph and update the modeCount && edgeSize && size

     */
public node_data removeNode(int key);

    /**
     * Delete the edge from the graph,
     * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
     * check if has two Vertex in the graph by node1 key && node2 key

     * after we delete we compare the old size of the number of the Neighbors with the new size
     * if there isn't equality between the sizes we update the edgeSize && modeCount
     * @param node1
     * @param node2
     */
public void removeEdge(int node1, int node2);

    /**
     * return the number of vertices (nodes) in the graph.
     * Note: this method should run in O(1) time.
     * return the number of the Vertex in the graph
     * @return hmap.size int
     */
public int nodeSize();

   /**
     * return the number of edges (undirectional graph).

     * return the number of the actions in the graph
     * @return modeCount int
     */
public int getMC();



*********_Graph_Algo class function:_*********

The third class is called "Graph_Algo Class".
This class executes algorithmic operations on graphs which were created by "Graphs_DS" (ONLY undirected graphs).
We implement the interface "graph_algorithms" in the code "Graph_Algo" to perform algorithmic operations on different graphs.
The Data Structures which I used is "LinkedList && List" since it is very effective for the algorithms which we use.
In this class we will use the parameters "Tag && Info" which we have in the interface "node_data" which is used in the code "NodeData".
In this class we will perform the following steps:


    /**
     * constructor for Graph_Algo to create new empty graph
     * @return none return
     */
public Graph_Algo();

    /**
     * constructor for Graph_Algo to create object with initialization to the graph
     * @param g graph
     * @return none return
     */
public Graph_Algo(graph g)

    /**
     * Init this set of algorithms on the parameter - graph.
     * that function is to change the value of the graph inside the object
     * @param g
     */
public void init(graph g);

    /**
     * Compute a deep copy of this graph.
     * we run first to add the Vertex from the graph
     * after we run by the Vertex to add all the list of Neighbors to the nodes
     * @return newGraph graph (the new graph)
     */
public graph copy();

    /**
     * Returns true if and only if (iff) there is a valid path from EVREY node to each
     * other node. NOTE: assume directional graph - a valid path (a-->b) does NOT imply a valid path (b-->a).
     * is connected : in a given graph if the size of vertexes is equal to 0/1 that means there is an edge between each vertex to another
     * (in case size=1 the vertex is connected to itself by definition).
     * otherwise the BFS algorithm starts with the first vertex in the graph we update the tag of the node in the run
     * after that we run by all the vertex and if we get that the tag is equals to 0 return false
     * else return true
     * @return true if there is a valid path from EVREY node to each' false if isn't
     */
public boolean isConnected();

    /**
     * returns the length of the shortest path between src to dest
     * if the two keys are equals the path is 0
     * if they're not equal we check if the two nodes exist in the graph,

     * @param dest - end (target) node
